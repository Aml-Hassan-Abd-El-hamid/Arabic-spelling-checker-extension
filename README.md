# Arabic-spelling-checker-extension
That project started as a task from WideBot comapny, that was the email that I recived:

```
For our second task, we're looking at spelling correction - a vital feature for any text-based service. Your mission is to build a super-efficient spelling correction API. It should take a word as input and return a list of probable corrections, sorted by likelihood, or the word itself if it's already correct. Wrap this functionality up nicely in an API, and you're golden!
```

I chose to go with Flask giving the fact that I had an experience using it in that [cute project](https://github.com/Aml-Hassan-Abd-El-hamid/cat-breeds-classification-website) I actully can't remember anything regarding Flask from it but at least I can use the codebase from it.

Due to some calculation issue, I have 1 day to finish that project, I found a very fast starting solution by using that library called [ar_corrector](https://github.com/basselkassem/ar_corrector)
